	/* The Wumpus World problem deals with an AI robot navigating its way through a 4x4 puzzle to try and find gold. The robot must safely navigate its way around the evil Wumpus creatures to locate the gold on the board.
    An agent is placed at a location in the grid which is its starting point and is given a destination point ie gold. The actions available to the agent consist of moving in one of four directions.
	In order to perform q-learning for this task, a description of the states, actions, and rewards is needed. A qmatrix is updated every time the agent "learns" using the Belford's Formula.
	After training, the agent is able to find the gold while avoiding the hazards of the Wumpus World.


	1> The environment is a grid of dimensions, here 4 x 4 squares.
	2> A robot/agent is placed at a location in the grid which is its starting point.
	3> The robot/agent is given a destination point. here, gold
	4> The robot has a fixed set of actions i.e. moving right, moving left etc
	5> The robot/agent is surrounded by walls and can only perceive the world  after coming in contact with it: i.e. bumping into wall etc
	6> There is a rewarding system based on the action taken : for example positive reward reinforcement for correct action taken, negative reward reinforcement for incorrect action taken etc.
	7> The objective is to implent an RL algorithm with which the robot reaches its destination.
